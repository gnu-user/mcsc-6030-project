Enhancement of Matrix Multiplication using Parallelization and Evolutionary Strategies
=======================================================================================

Project Summary
----------------------------------------

The purpose of this project is to study the common serial implementations of
matrix multiplication and to study the performance benefits of parallel and
approximate solutions. Matrix multiplication is a very well defined problem,
the results can be easily confirmed and benchmarked using a set of defined
matrices for all experiments.

The project utilizes the programming language Python and uses Numpy to perform
matrix operations. The software matrix multiplication algorithms developed
consist of parallel implementations of matrix multiplication algorithms
utilizing the CPU and GPU and approximate algorithms for performing matrix
multiplications generated using evolutionary strategies and evaluated within a
tolerance of error.
